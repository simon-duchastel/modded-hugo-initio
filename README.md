# Description

This is a custom Hugo theme, modified from the Hugo Initio theme (which is itself ported from the Initio bootstrap template by GetTemplate).

The modifications involved are mostly around added customization to support organization use-cases, rather than a template focused solely on showcases of an individual.

## Original Theme

For more information on the original theme, please see the [original source code here](https://github.com/miguelsimoni/hugo-initio).
